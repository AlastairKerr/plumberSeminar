All code has my URLs.  Obviously change these if you wish to try it yourself. 

The master run sheet is a R notebook.  This is convenient for the seminar but I would use RScript with upstart job or docker to deploy any real instances.

## ABSTRACT: 

R-Markdown and R-Shiny facilitate R-programmers to communicate their data and ideas to other people.  But how can R-code and data be made interoperable with other computers and programming languages?

Representational State Transfer [REST], is a common standard that enables RESTful applications to communicate over HTTP and is found in many web services. The R package “plumber” adds this functionality easily to existing R-code.  

I will explain what you need to know about creating your own RESTful program in R and plumber, highlighting some key features and security considerations.  Assuming internet connections and firewalls are working as expected, there should also be a live demo that will allow you to interact with the apps using a laptop or smartphone.
